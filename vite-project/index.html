      <h2>.About()</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Alex Lundquist, currently on the path to a Fullstack developer career. Prior to diving into the world
        of computer software, I pursued an athletic career in Alpine skiing, competing at the Europe Cup level with the
        goal of reaching the Olympic Games.
      </p>
      <p>
        The allure of coding lies in the ability to create almost anything, coupled with the ever-evolving landscape of
        software technology that keeps me consistently engaged. My current skill set includes proficiency in C#,
        ASP.NET,REST Api, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with plans to expand and diversify my capabilities in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond coding, you can explore the rest of my website to learn more about my journey and projects. Discover them
        at the bottom of the page and feel free to connect with me. I look forward to sharing more about my passion for
        coding and my ongoing exploration of the vast possibilities within the realm of software development.
